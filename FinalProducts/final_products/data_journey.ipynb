    "The point of this milestone was to get our data and develop a plan. Our plan was to take the World Bank and UN data and try to use it to see if there were any features that could be controlled by humans that predicted population change well. We were in the early stages of our discussion at this point, but we ended up downloading the data, reformatting it into panel data, and uploading it to a PostgreSQL database. We also created a file that matches column indicators with their full names, which was necessary to know what data we were looking at."

    "We got deeper into the analysis and found that there was a large drop in population under age 4 during the 1990s, which later recovered to normal levels. We found this odd, so upon investigating, found that China could explain most of this drop. The most likely explanation is that this was the result of the one child policy, but we didn't have time to test this hypothesis. It did lead to some discussion on whether or not this kind of policy is the solution to our problem.\n",
