# Masters-Capstone
Capstone Project from my master's degree. My group, consisting of four people including me, analyzed population trends
using data obtained from World Bank.

The FinalProducts directory contains a file called data_journey.ipynb, which summarizes the project and gives links to 
relevant work in the order in which we completed it. It also contains a pdf of the slides we used in our capstone defense
presentation. Additionally, there is a file called MFinal, which contains links to the previously mentioned files in addition
to an RShiny dashboard that we made. With this information, one should be able to follow the logical path of the project
using the notebooks.
