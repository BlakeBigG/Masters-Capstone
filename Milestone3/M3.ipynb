    "This milestone contains all of our exploratory data analysis, visuals, and work on unsupervised learning. The suggested order to follow would be to start with the notebooks in the basic_analysis directory first, then move to the correlation_analysis directory, and finally the deeper_analysis directory. The other directories have no bearing on one another, so they can be viewed in any order."
